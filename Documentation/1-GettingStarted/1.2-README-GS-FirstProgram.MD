# First program - HelloWorld.cpp 
This is the first c++ program created using from w3schools. It was created to ensure development environment setup worked fine.   

If there are environment/tool related errors, they would be highlighted. 

Following steps were used to compile and run the program - 
1. Create a repository in GitHub with README file  
2. Clone the repository in local folder 
3. Create following  sub - folders in local clone -  
    source ==> to save the code
    compiled ==> to save the compiled version (for my repository, this folder is not uploaded to GitHub) 
4. Create the HelloWorld.cpp file in the "source" folder
5. Add the code. Ensure all syntax errors are fixed. 
6. To compile the program, Go to the folder named "compiled"
7. In the VSCode Powershell or bash termninal, Run the following command - 
```
PS [Folder in your local drive - e.g. C:\code,  E:\, etc]\cpp-secure-coding\compiled> g++ ..\source\HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld.exe 
```
This command tells the g++ command to compile HelloWorld.cpp from the "source" folder" and place the output into HelloWorld.exe file
If there are no errors, a file called HelloWorld.exe should be created in the "compiled" folder
8. Run the following command to execute the program- 
```
.\HelloWorld.exe
```

If no errors, the following should be printed in the terminal -  

> Hello World!


## Optional - Uploading to GitHub
1. For this repository, only documentation and source folders are being synced to GitHub
