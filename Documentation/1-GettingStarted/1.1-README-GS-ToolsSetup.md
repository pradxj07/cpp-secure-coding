# Getting Started 
## Environment and tools used 
1. Windows 10 
2. Microsoft VS Code
3. Microsoft C/C++ Extension - see here https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools
4. MinGW compiler for c++ - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw
    As you can see in the link above, the installation has two parts  
    1. Part 1 - Installing the MinGW-w64 toolchain - Install MSYS2 from the official website: https://www.msys2.org
    2. Part 2 - Actual g++ compiler - see pacman instruction in the page mentioned above
## Optional
5. Git (or any other version control tool) - for saving file versions in GitHub
6. GitHub account 
7. Other - additional tools/ extension may be required to integrate  Git into VSCode 

With the above, cpp code can be compiled in the powershell or bash terminal within Visual Studio Code. 
VS code also has a checklist to get you started by it has instructions to install a different compiler.
